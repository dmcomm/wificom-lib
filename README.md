This library enables an RP2040 device using dmcomm-python (CircuitPython 8.x/7.3.x) to connect to https://wificom.dev to enable DigiRom reading and writing via HTTP API calls and MQTT for device interactions.

## Credits

This project was enabled by the great work, help, and input from BladeSabre.  Find the repo this one is built on top of at https://github.com/dmcomm/dmcomm-python.

Credits to the other great developers on the WiFiCom Discord.

A list of contributors will come as pull requests appear

## RP2040 Board Support

### Supported Boards
- Arduino Nano Connect
- RP2040 with AirLift co-processor module
    - Pi Pico is the only tested board so far but others should work as well

### Unsupported Boards
- RP2040 Challenger with WiFi Chip
    - Issues with SSL with onboard chip; doesn't allow for secure requests

## Building a (WiFi) Pico-Com
- Visit https://dmcomm.github.io/guide/pi-pico/ for more information on this topic
- Ensure you match pins on your supported board with those found in the example code.py file.  This has been optimized by BladeSabre for the Arduino Nano Connect.  If you have a different board, you will need to adjust the pins in the code.py file.
- Be careful to use the correct version of CircuitPython, this impacts your choice of library downloads.  See Installation for more details.

## Installation

1. Drag and drop the "wificom" folder in this repository to your "lib" folder in your "CIRCUITPY" drive
1. Drag and drop the "code.py" file to your "CIRCUITPY" drive, replace existing "code.py"
1. Drag and drop the "boot.py" file into the "CIRCUITPY" drive, replace existing "boot.py"
1. Install dmcomm-python into the repository
    1. Drag and drop the "lib/dmcomm" folder into the lib folder in your "CIRCUITPY" drive
1. Install the following libs, find all of these in the libs folder of the CircuitPython [AdaFruit bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases) (8.x mpy archive) (7.x CircuitPython version might work, use the appropriate bundle)
   1. adafruit_bus_device
   1. adafruit_esp32spi
   1. adafruit_io
   1. adafruit_minimqtt
   1. adafruit_requests.mpy

1. Copy the "secrets.py.example" to "secrets.py" and make changes to match your environment (you can get a prefilled version on the website)
1. Modify "board_config.py" so that pinouts match your board, we advise using what you find as default but you can modify as needed
1. Test that everything works, you should see the following output from Arduino IDE Serial Monitor
